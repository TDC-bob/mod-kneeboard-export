KNEEBOARD Export for 'multimonitorsetup.lua' DCS 1.2.4

***************************************
All tests are made in DCS World 1.2.4
***************************************
This will enable you to place the Kneeboard in all modules exactly were you want/need it.  

This Mod comes in two different flavours :

1. Default Look  - this just enables the export function

2. New Look - reworked layout  - see "Default vs. New Look.jpg" for details.



Installation:
-------------
Copy the contend of your chosen flavour into your DCS World install and allow to overwrite.
Example path:
H:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World

***************************************

Usage:
------

Select in
OPTIONS > SYSTEM > MONITORS > 'KNEEBOARD Test'
to check the function.

See included "Kneeboard_Test.jpg" for details.

You have to insert the
"KNEEBOARD =" 
export in all "monitorsetup".lua files you are using for right function of the Kneeboard.
Use a aspect of 2:3 for a distortion-less Map.

If your "monitorsetup".lua has not the Kneeboard entry in it,
you will have a very tiny map in the upper left corner.
